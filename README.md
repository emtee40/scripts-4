**`batch`**
 - `convert_microsoft_office_to_pdf.vbs` contains code which has been written on this [blog post](http://www.thoughtasylum.com/blog/2012/12/20/vbscript-to-convert-microsoft-office-files-word-excel-powerp.html) by Thought Asylum.  The associated batch file is original work, and still works with both Microsoft Office 2013 and 2016.
