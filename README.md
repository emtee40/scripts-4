Please note that certain scripts have been adapted from existing code found online, or use other softwares.

**`batch`**
 - `convert_microsoft_office_to_pdf.vbs` contains code which has been written on this [blog post](http://www.thoughtasylum.com/blog/2012/12/20/vbscript-to-convert-microsoft-office-files-word-excel-powerp.html) by Thought Asylum.  The associated batch file is original work, and still works with both Microsoft Office 2013 and 2016.
 - `manage_pictures.bat` uses the amazing [ExifTool](https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/) by Phil Harvey.

**`powershell`**

 - `get_chkdsk_results.ps1` is adapted from code found in this [tutorial](https://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/96938-check-disk-chkdsk-read-event-viewer-log.html) on Windows Seven Forums.

 **`registry`**

- `remove_3D_Objects_Folder` and `restore_3D_Objects_Folder` have been directly taken from this [article](https://www.howtogeek.com/331361/how-to-remove-the-3d-objects-folder-from-this-pc-on-windows-10/) on How-To Geek.
